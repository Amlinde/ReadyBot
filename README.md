# ReadyBot
Discord Bot for checking how many people are ready to play games


If you download it to run for yourself, you're gonna need to make a config.json file with this format: 

{
	"token": "",
	"testToken": ""
}

Except you obviously fill in the quotes with the relevant bot tokens.

You also need to add an empty file called 'generics' to the 'text' and 'dm' files. (unless I have since updated the bot to have stuff in these files, in which case it probably syncs)
